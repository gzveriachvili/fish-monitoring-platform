# fish-monitoring-platform
A prototype website created for marine biologists (and for the general crowd). It is capable of displaying video data, the fish count in the form of an interactive chart, while it also enables the users to create, edit, and delete notes. 

The website was created as part of the P6 Bachelor Project along with the other members of group MTA21634.
